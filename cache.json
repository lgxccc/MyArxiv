We show that this subclass of\ntransformers is expressively equivalent to the programming language C-RASP and\nthis equivalence preserves depth. Second, we prove that deeper C-RASP programs\nare more expressive than shallower C-RASP programs, implying that deeper\ntransformers are more expressive than shallower transformers (within the\nsubclass mentioned above). The same is also proven for transformers with\npositional encodings (like RoPE and ALiBi). These results are established by\nstudying a temporal logic with counting operators equivalent to C-RASP.\nFinally, we provide empirical evidence that our theory predicts the depth\nrequired for transformers without positional encodings to length-generalize on\na family of sequential dependency tasks.\n","authors":["Andy Yang","Michaël Cadilhac","David Chiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16055v2.pdf","comment":"35 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773v2","updated":"2025-10-24T17:44:52Z","published":"2025-07-31T17:57:20Z","title":"SimuRA: A World-Model-Driven Simulative Reasoning Architecture for\n  General Goal-Oriented Agents","summary":"  AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice,\nhowever, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short\nof scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from\nblack-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token\nwithout explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes.

Based on a principled\nformulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses\nthe limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the\nworld model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is\nimplemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a\ndiscrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while\nremaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search,\nSimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative\nopen-web agent baseline.

We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs\neffectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's\ndecision boundaries more effectively than standard data.

However, training\ntransformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost\nassociated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of\nitems. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak\nmemory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length.\nRecognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems\ntypically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss\nwith negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the\nfinal layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model\nperformance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of\nnegative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance,\nbut rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).\n  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient\nimplementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates\ntraining by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10\ntimes. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training,\nit becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item\ncatalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss\nfunctions. Finally, we perform an analysis of key memory-related\nhyperparameters and highlight the necessity of a delicate balance among these\nfactors.

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

Even fundamental questions, such as how\nfine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical\nevaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the\ngeometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of\ntraining and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a\ncontextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during\ntraining and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights\ninto the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically,\nthe mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training\ncapabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,\noverfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as\nillustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a\npractical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany\nand predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to\nprovide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of\nfine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when\nconfiguring models for specific applications.

By combining customized hardware design, system-level\nscheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our\nframework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs\nentirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent\nassistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher\nthroughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The\ndesign further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage\nthrough token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system\noutperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy\nconsumption by 42.3\\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\\%. This enables a\nbattery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a\nday and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.\n","authors":["Yilong Li","Shuai Zhang","Yijing Zeng","Hao Zhang","Xinmiao Xiong","Jingyu Liu","Pan Hu","Suman Banerjee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05109v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17516v3","updated":"2025-10-27T14:17:13Z","published":"2025-10-20T13:14:38Z","title":"SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate\n  Human Behaviors","summary":"  Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential\nto revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they\nfaithfully reflect real human behaviors.

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given\nonly a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without\nrestriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that\nhypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we\npropose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental\nassumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research\nbackground and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three\npractical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with\ninspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient\nset of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop\nan agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this\nmathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a\nbenchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January\n2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations,\nand hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high\nsimilarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core\ninnovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with\nknowledge cutoff date prior to 2024.

Many existing interpretability are limited in\nthis area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward\npasses of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold\nduring reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence\nlevel is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We\nintroduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual\nimportance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model,\nfiltering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought\nfrom that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution\nof final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized\nimpact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these\nsentences \\textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty\nmanagement sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from\nsubsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining\nsentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a\nmodel's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's\ndifficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or\ndiffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques\ntogether provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by\nconducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math\nproblem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the\nreasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool\n(thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further\nproblems.

While Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end\ngeneration approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue\nthis failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two\ndisparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format\nadherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay.

However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by\ndefault, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the\nreal-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability\nwhen an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has\npassed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often\neither over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or\nunder-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,\nwe introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across\n34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user\nquestion, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed\nsince the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue\nmessages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and\nevolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,\ncreating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous\nobservation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call\n(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with\nhuman preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show\nthat without time information, most models perform only slightly better than\nrandom, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding\ntimestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the\nimprovement is modest, peaking at around 65%.

With the rapid development of large language\nmodels (LLMs), recent research has explored leveraging the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs to enhance rating prediction tasks. However, existing\ndistillation-based methods suffer from limitations such as the teacher model's\ninsufficient recommendation capability, costly and static supervision, and\nsuperficial transfer of reasoning ability.

Instead, RecZero trains a single LLM through pure RL to autonomously\ndevelop reasoning capabilities for rating prediction. RecZero consists of two\nkey components: (1) \"Think-before-Recommendation\" prompt construction, which\nemploys a structured reasoning template to guide the model in step-wise\nanalysis of user interests, item features, and user-item compatibility; and (2)\nrule-based reward modeling, which adopts group relative policy optimization\n(GRPO) to compute rewards for reasoning trajectories and optimize the LLM.\nAdditionally, the paper explores a hybrid paradigm, RecOne, which combines\nsupervised fine-tuning with RL, initializing the model with cold-start\nreasoning samples and further optimizing it with RL.

This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation.

While query\nreformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR\nmethods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth)\nor elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In\nthis paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large\nlanguage model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by\ngenerating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations.

To address these issues, we propose Time-Varying Mesh Compression\n(TVMC), a novel framework built on multi-stage coarse-to-fine anchor mesh\ngeneration for inter-frame prediction. Specifically, the anchor mesh is\nprogressively constructed in three stages: initial, coarse, and fine. The\ninitial anchor mesh is obtained through fast topology alignment to exploit\ntemporal coherence. A Kalman filter-based motion estimation module then\ngenerates a coarse anchor mesh by accurately compensating inter-frame motions.\nSubsequently, a Quadric Error Metric-based refinement step optimizes vertex\npositions to form a fine anchor mesh with improved geometric fidelity. Based on\nthe refined anchor mesh, the inter-frame motions relative to the reference base\nmesh are encoded, while the residual displacements between the subdivided fine\nanchor mesh and the input mesh are adaptively quantized and compressed. This\nhierarchical strategy preserves consistent connectivity and high-quality\nsurface approximation, while achieving an efficient and compact representation\nof dynamic geometry. Extensive experiments on standard MPEG dynamic mesh\nsequences demonstrate that TVMC achieves state-of-the-art compression\nperformance. Compared to the latest V-DMC standard, it delivers a significant\nBD-rate gain of 10.2% ~ 16.9%, while preserving high reconstruction quality.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/H-Huang774/TVMC.\n","authors":["He Huang","Qi Yang","Yiling Xu","Zhu Li","Jenq-Neng Hwang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.22646v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22622v1","updated":"2025-10-26T10:40:52Z","published":"2025-10-26T10:40:52Z","title":"DeepfakeBench-MM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Deepfake\n  Detection","summary":"  The misuse of advanced generative AI models has resulted in the widespread\nproliferation of falsified data, particularly forged human-centric audiovisual\ncontent, which poses substantial societal risks (e.g., financial fraud and\nsocial instability).

Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and\naudio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance\npredictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly\nassigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we\ndesign a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and\nvisual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their\ncomplementary contexts.

However, the impact of such role prompts on model\nreasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\n  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to\nevaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\n  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.\nWe test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to\nassess changes in reasoning pathways. Our\n  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the\nmedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\n  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of\ndistinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\n  across clinical roles.

This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and\nemphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine\n  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the\nrelated code in the following repository:https:\n  //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor\n","authors":["Xun Liang","Huayi Lai","Hanyu Wang","Wentao Zhang","Linfeng Zhang","Yanfang Chen","Feiyu Xiong","Zhiyu Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24677v1.pdf","comment":"15 pages, 9 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24668v1","updated":"2025-10-28T17:35:54Z","published":"2025-10-28T17:35:54Z","title":"InteractComp: Evaluating Search Agents With Ambiguous Queries","summary":"  Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and\ninformation retrieval.

However,\nwhen a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.\nDisambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS\nassociated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.\nThe problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language\nprocessing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,\nexpression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.\nLexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural\nlanguage processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce\nmultiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct\nsolution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence\nrate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is\nunrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a\nlexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate\nand implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal\ndescription of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation\ngrammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer\npaths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a\ncombination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by\nconsidering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling\nof a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come\nspontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often\ndue to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is\ntargeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed\nspecification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be\nnecessary.\n","authors":["Eric G. C.

Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking\nto develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework\nthat equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual\nrepresentations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual\nunderstanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without\ncompromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach\nintegrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive\nreasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the\ngeneration of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process\nand can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,\nwe introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively\nproduces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these\ninto human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset\nMazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad\ndelivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.\nIt further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and\nQwen2.5-VL.

Hence, in this work we define a new problem: Zero-Shot Tokenizer\nTransfer (ZeTT). The challenge at the core of ZeTT is finding embeddings for\nthe tokens in the vocabulary of the new tokenizer. Since prior heuristics for\ninitializing embeddings often perform at chance level in a ZeTT setting, we\npropose a new solution: we train a hypernetwork taking a tokenizer as input and\npredicting the corresponding embeddings.

In\nstage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct\nrule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on\nactor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its\ndiscriminability via appropriate regularization.

It\ntargets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$\nmemory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents\nweights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently\nbinarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme\nprecision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes\nrow, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank\nimportance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual\nSign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware\ntraining (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate\nerrors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit\nquantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading\nmethod's 0.7 BPW.

Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill\nacceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute\nreduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the\nlayer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy\ndegradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression\nframework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging\nthe stabilization of token importance in later layers.

In this\npaper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL\nfine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We\nintroduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,\nprioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield\ninformative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we\ndevelop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small\nreference set of questions.

This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions.

In this work, we\nintroduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to\nprobe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use.\nBrainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with\nmultiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight\nor a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language\nmodels (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on\ncorrectness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We\ninvestigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the\nbrainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2)\ngenerating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting\nsolutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of\nsolutions; and (5) making use of hints.

Recently, implicit CoT approaches have\nemerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed\n``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates\nCoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.\nHowever, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)\nthey fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning\n(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,\nresulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on\nreducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the\nconsiderable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning\ntoken. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned\nimplicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,\nwe design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic\nalignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce\nsemantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the\nsecond challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by\nfinetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This\ngenerator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth\nreasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing\nfor accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by\njointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic\nalignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both\nefficiency and effectiveness.

To overcome these limitations, we propose RAXO, a\ntraining-free framework that repurposes off-the-shelf RGB OvOD detectors for\nrobust X-ray detection. RAXO builds high-quality X-ray class descriptors using\na dual-source retrieval strategy.

These visual descriptors replace text-based\nclassification in OvOD, leveraging intra-modal feature distances for robust\ndetection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAXO consistently improves\nOvOD performance, providing an average mAP increase of up to 17.0 points over\nbase detectors.

We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,\nSpiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an\noptical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve\naround 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by\nangular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion\nrecognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research.

These models typically rely on general-purpose\nencoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI)\nclassification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from\nimages. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of\npathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain\nan overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate\ncomprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final\ndiagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this\ngap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics\npathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based\non observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent\nand interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a\nmulti-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and\nWSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for\nreplicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales.\nAdditionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark\nfor large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale\nbetween patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where\npathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire\nslides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently\noutperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image\nscales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and\nhighlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.\n","authors":["Yuxuan Sun","Yixuan Si","Chenglu Zhu","Kai Zhang","Zhongyi Shui","Bowen Ding","Tao Lin","Lin Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20510v2.pdf","comment":"52 pages, 34 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17550v3","updated":"2025-10-28T09:32:18Z","published":"2025-09-22T09:09:13Z","title":"Is It Certainly a Deepfake?

The rationale\nof our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and\nnon-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and\ncontrollable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional\ndiffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled\nLatent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity\nfeatures, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs\nand aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent\nHarmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on\nnoisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based\nreconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement.

To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the\nfirst cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual\nsemantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a\ntarget-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly\nassigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation.

To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using\ncomponent attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each\ncomponent (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The\nproposed framework, called \\textbf{C}omponent \\textbf{A}ttribution for\n\\textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing\n(positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components\nthat contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the\nprevious knowledge localization work.

We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel\ntraining strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from\nuncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the\nneed for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,\nwhich assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which\nstabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss\ncovariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.\nCoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method\ntrainable via gradient descent.

These models approximate low-dimensional\nmarginals or query workloads; crucially, they require the training data to be\npre-discretized, i.e., continuous values need to first be partitioned into\nbins. However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred\ndirectly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges\ntypically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP\nguarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.\n  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four\ndiscretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More\nprecisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and\nk-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both\nthe choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by\nalmost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and\nnumber of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the\nmajority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with\nnon-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks,\napplying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk. Finally, we\nimprove on an existing approach for automatically selecting the optimal number\nof bins, and achieve high utility while reducing both privacy budget\nconsumption and computational overhead.\n","authors":["Georgi Ganev","Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai","Sofiane Mahiou","Emiliano De Cristofaro"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06923v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24452v1","updated":"2025-10-28T14:18:50Z","published":"2025-10-28T14:18:50Z","title":"ARIMA_PLUS: Large-scale, Accurate, Automatic and Interpretable\n  In-Database Time Series Forecasting and Anomaly Detection in Google BigQuery","summary":"  Time series forecasting and anomaly detection are common tasks for\npractitioners in industries such as retail, manufacturing, advertising and\nenergy.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from\ngeneralization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical\nanalysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and\na later time $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges.

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction.

However, most existing\naugmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes\n-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality\nsynthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is\nessential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as\ntraining data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and\nnetwork architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a\nnovel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the\ndata generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data\nvia downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight\nallocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic\nsample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data\ngeneration process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the\nsynthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative\nmodel to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts\ngeneration policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each\ngeneration round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying\ncomplexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over\nprevious SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that\nUtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating\nthe effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to\ntask utility-centric data augmentation.\n","authors":["Jiyu Guo","Shuo Yang","Yiming Huang","Yancheng Long","Xiaobo Xia","Xiu Su","Bo Zhao","Zeke Xie","Liqiang Nie"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24262v1.pdf","comment":"39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS\n  2025)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256v1","updated":"2025-10-28T10:09:35Z","published":"2025-10-28T10:09:35Z","title":"From Memorization to Reasoning in the Spectrum of Loss Curvature","summary":"  We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and\nshow that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)\nand vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss\nlandscape curvature.

This motivates a\nweight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted\nmemorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method\n(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity.

Efficient compression must preserve\ndiagnostic fidelity while minimizing redundancy. Low-rank matrix approximation\n(LoRMA) techniques have shown strong potential for image compression by\ncapturing global correlations; however, they often fail to adapt to local\nstructural variations across regions of interest. To address this, we introduce\nan adaptive LoRMA, which partitions a medical image into overlapping patches,\ngroups structurally similar patches into clusters using k-means, and performs\nSVD within each cluster. We derive the overall compression factor accounting\nfor patch overlap and analyze how patch size influences compression efficiency\nand computational cost. While applicable to any data with high local variation,\nwe focus on medical imaging due to its pronounced local variability. We\nevaluate and compare our adaptive LoRMA against global SVD across four imaging\nmodalities: MRI, ultrasound, CT scan, and chest X-ray. Results demonstrate that\nadaptive LoRMA effectively preserves structural integrity, edge details, and\ndiagnostic relevance, measured by PSNR, SSIM, MSE, IoU, and EPI. Adaptive LoRMA\nminimizes block artifacts and residual errors, particularly in pathological\nregions, consistently outperforming global SVD in PSNR, SSIM, IoU, EPI, and\nachieving lower MSE. It prioritizes clinically salient regions while allowing\naggressive compression in non-critical regions, optimizing storage efficiency.\nAlthough adaptive LoRMA requires higher processing time, its diagnostic\nfidelity justifies the overhead for high-compression applications.\n","authors":["Sisipho Hamlomo","Marcellin Atemkeng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08256v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24217v1","updated":"2025-10-28T09:30:52Z","published":"2025-10-28T09:30:52Z","title":"Closing Gaps: An Imputation Analysis of ICU Vital Signs","summary":"  As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in\ndeveloping clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols\nincreases.

To address these questions, we analyze the\nresidual stream of the Llama 3.1, Qwen 3, and OLMo 2 family of models.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and\ncorresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements\nin interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in\nmulti-agent LLM systems. We test six models on well-established sets of moral\ndilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reason independently,\nand (2) Group, where they engage in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads.\nIn personal dilemmas, where agents decide whether to directly harm an\nindividual for the benefit of others, all models rated moral violations as more\nacceptable when part of a group, demonstrating a Utilitarian Boost similar to\nthat observed in humans. However, the mechanism for the Boost in LLMs differed:\nWhile humans in groups become more utilitarian due to heightened sensitivity to\ndecision outcomes, LLM groups showed either reduced sensitivity to norms or\nenhanced impartiality. We report model differences in when and how strongly the\nBoost manifests. We also discuss prompt and agent compositions that enhance or\nmitigate the effect.

Building on prior\nstudies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce\nbibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is\ngenerated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear\nin the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume\ncitation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency\nwith which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the\npretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated\nreferences in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified\n100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured\nfactual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic\nmetadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across\nresearch domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual\naccuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly\nmemorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets.

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process.

The method is based on two new neural\nnetworks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of\nradar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on\nappearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method\nusing open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The\nexperimental results show that our method can successfully generate\nhigh-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object\ndetection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar.

Most prior work,\nhowever, inserts textual chains-of-thought (CoT) as intermediate steps tailored\nto the current scene. Such symbolic compressions can blur spatio-temporal\nrelations and discard fine visual cues, creating a cross-modal gap between\nperception and planning. We propose FSDrive, a visual spatio-temporal CoT\nframework that enables VLAs to think in images. The model first acts as a world\nmodel to generate a unified future frame that overlays coarse but\nphysically-plausible priors-future lane dividers and 3D boxes-on the predicted\nfuture image. This unified frame serves as the visual CoT, capturing both\nspatial structure and temporal evolution. The same VLA then functions as an\ninverse-dynamics model, planning trajectories from current observations and the\nvisual CoT. To equip VLAs with image generation while preserving understanding,\nwe introduce a unified pre-training paradigm that expands the vocabulary to\ninclude visual tokens and jointly optimizes VQA (for semantics) and\nfuture-frame prediction (for dynamics). A progressive easy-to-hard scheme first\npredicts lane/box priors to enforce physical constraints, then completes full\nfuture frames for fine details. On nuScenes and NAVSIM, FSDrive improves\ntrajectory accuracy and reduces collisions under both ST-P3 and UniAD metrics,\nand attains competitive FID for future-frame generation despite using\nlightweight autoregression. It also advances scene understanding on DriveLM.\nTogether, these results indicate that visual CoT narrows the cross-modal gap\nand yields safer, more anticipatory planning.

However, most previous methods\nusually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects\nand gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both\nthe training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an\nauxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization\nacross the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the\nsuboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,\nwe propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the\ngaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity\nover Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to\nvariations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze\nobject detection and gaze following tasks.\n","authors":["Yang Jin","Guangyu Guo","Binglu Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25301v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23051v2","updated":"2025-10-29T09:09:07Z","published":"2025-09-27T02:12:09Z","title":"Activation Matching for Explanation Generation","summary":"  In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate\nminimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained\nclassifier on any given image.

This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data.

The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and\nimprove their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is\nto generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an\nimage that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be\nmisleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel\nspaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates\na standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image\npre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting\ncaption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the\nmost to the models prediction.

However, existing methods still struggle to\nachieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free\n(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by\nproviding fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require\nextensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their\naccessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling\nimage generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over\nfacial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that\nenables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity\npreservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model\nto extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$\nlatent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder.

Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that\nencourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,\nleading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the\nhuman-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but\nthink carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when\nreasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training\nstrategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective\n'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with\nempty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold\nstart for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to\nfreely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome\nrewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by\nup to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even\nimproving it. Further evaluations across LLM (GSM8K), VLM (CLEVR, Super-CLEVR,\nGeoQA), and Agentic (AITZ) tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties\nunder both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively\nlearns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances.

Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

However, current LLM-based approaches face critical\nlimitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to\ninference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods\ntypically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent\ninteractions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals.\nSecond, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single\npredicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and\nlimiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose\nHyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which\nleverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from\nlong user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest\nembeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a\nresidual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression\nand reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of\nusers, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages\nmultiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals\nadaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected\nindustrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec\nbrings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

Mainstream approaches\nfollow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling\nitem topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics\nbased on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the\nmodeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical\nconfounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the\nbehavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and\nlearn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show\nthat it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient\nintegration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems,\nfor which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal)\nLLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic\ntag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of\nusers, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF\npresents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the\nextracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We\nconduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and\npublic datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically\nshow that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than\nthe modeling of item topics.

A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models.

However, updating\nthem with continuously arriving behavior sequences incurs high computational\ncosts or leads to catastrophic forgetting. Although continual learning, a\nstandard approach for non-stationary data streams, has recently been applied to\nrecommendation, existing methods gradually forget long-term user preferences\nand remain underexplored in SR.

The core of\nCSTRec is Continual Sequential Attention (CSA), a linear attention tailored for\ncontinual SR, which enables CSTRec to partially retain historical knowledge\nwithout direct access to prior data.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the\nbrain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient\nbrain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks\n(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before\nlearning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative\ninference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster\ntraining. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the\ninference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep\nPCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards\nscaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.\nFirst, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an\napproximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite\nexplicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this\napproximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily\nhigher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective\nlandscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing\ngradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape.

This paper fills that gap by systematically\ninvestigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical\nperformance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the\ncomparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our\ncomprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained\nformats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart\nin both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit\nformats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we\nshow that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like\nHadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method\nthat resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling\nnearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training.

Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify\nsubgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of\ngraph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of\nhigh quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process.

We show that the\npre-trained model generalizes effectively to single-depot variants, achieving\nperformance comparable to models trained specifically on single-depot\ninstances.

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing\na novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two\ndistinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and\npersistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation\nand prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of\n90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around\nthis framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and\narchitectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific\nimplementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how\napplication constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific\nethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation\nstrategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:\nsymbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while\nneural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).\nFurthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant\ndeficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for\nhybrid neuro-symbolic architectures.

Building on a recent framework that proposes\nhow to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks,\nwe evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual\nspeech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit\nthe McGurk effect. We show that networks trained entirely on congruent\naudiovisual speech nevertheless exhibit the McGurk percept. We further\ninvestigated 'why' by comparing networks trained on clean speech to those\ntrained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to\na pronounced increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all\nmodels. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of\nauditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual\nintegration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed\nto develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical\nperiods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of\naudiovisual speech integration.

To address these issues, we\npropose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates\nsemantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This\nenables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its\nsemantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive\nrefinement.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation.\n","authors":["Woojin Kim","Jaeyoung Do"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26200v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted in NeurIPS 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15095v2","updated":"2025-10-30T07:18:23Z","published":"2025-05-21T04:34:22Z","title":"Nek Minit: Harnessing Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting for Explainable\n  Sarcasm Detection of Australian and Indian English","summary":"  Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity\nbetween stated and implied sentiment.

To better\nunderstand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition\nunder which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational\nmotif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of\ncontrolled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test\nwhether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of\nsubjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and\nbehavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained\nself-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured\nsubjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are\nmechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated\nwith deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features\nsharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them\nminimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential\nstate converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any\ncontrol condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer\nintrospection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only\nindirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of\nconsciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and\nreproducible condition under which large language models generate structured\nfirst-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,\nand behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across\narchitectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for\nfurther investigation.\n","authors":["Cameron Berg","Diogo de Lucena","Judd Rosenblatt"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24797v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14604v4","updated":"2025-10-30T02:36:10Z","published":"2025-05-20T16:53:40Z","title":"Let LRMs Break Free from Overthinking via Self-Braking Tuning","summary":"  Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have\nsignificantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains\nof thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks.\nHowever, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in\nredundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high\ncomputational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking.

The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human\nevaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.\n","authors":["Jing Lin","Ruisi Wang","Junzhe Lu","Ziqi Huang","Guorui Song","Ailing Zeng","Xian Liu","Chen Wei","Wanqi Yin","Qingping Sun","Zhongang Cai","Lei Yang","Ziwei Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26794v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786v1","updated":"2025-10-30T17:57:40Z","published":"2025-10-30T17:57:40Z","title":"HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies","summary":"  Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including\ncomputer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise\nfrom coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability.

Since locality is central to generalization, it is crucial to\nunderstand why diffusion models learn local behavior in the first place, as\nwell as the factors that govern the properties of locality patterns. In this\nwork, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as\na statistical property of the image dataset and is not due to the inductive\nbias of convolutional neural networks, as suggested in previous work.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser\nexhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers. We show, both\ntheoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from pixel\ncorrelations present in the image datasets. Moreover, locality patterns are\ndrastically different on specialized datasets, approximating principal\ncomponents of the data's covariance. We use these insights to craft an\nanalytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion\nmodel than prior expert-crafted alternatives.

Modeling the 3D\ndeformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately,\nadvancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer\nnew possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking\napproach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human\nactions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV\nmapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and\nviewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter\nspace. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies,\nmodifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural\nnetwork parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB\nimages and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture\nedits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation\nover Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on\nunseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.7%\nattack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic\nvideo settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou\nattack, which only had a 28.5% ASR.

Specifically, S4D employs dual-modal\nself-supervised pre-training on facial images and videos using a shared Vision\nTransformer (ViT) encoder-decoder architecture, yielding improved\nspatiotemporal representations. The pre-trained encoder is then fine-tuned on\nstatic and dynamic expression datasets in a multi-task learning setup to\nfacilitate emotional information interaction. Unfortunately, vanilla multi-task\nlearning in our study results in negative transfer. To address this, we propose\nan innovative Mixture of Adapter Experts (MoAE) module that facilitates\ntask-specific knowledge acquisition while effectively extracting shared\nknowledge from both static and dynamic expression data. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that S4D achieves a deeper understanding of DFER, setting new\nstate-of-the-art performance on FERV39K, MAFW, and DFEW benchmarks, with\nweighted average recall (WAR) of 53.65\\%, 58.44\\%, and 76.68\\%, respectively.\nAdditionally, a systematic correlation analysis between SFER and DFER tasks is\npresented, which further elucidates the potential benefits of leveraging SFER.\n","authors":["Yin Chen","Jia Li","Yu Zhang","Zhenzhen Hu","Shiguang Shan","Meng Wang","Richang Hong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06154v3.pdf","comment":"The code and model are publicly available here\n  https://github.com/MSA-LMC/S4D"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885v2","updated":"2025-10-30T12:02:27Z","published":"2025-09-28T13:50:29Z","title":"Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual\n  Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction","summary":"  Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily\non paired data and generalize poorly.

To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of\nTUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised\ncontextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual\nsubdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered\non the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the\nsubsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine\nknowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for\noptimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference\nreconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is\nproposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the\nimage fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In\naddition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and\nlower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for\nself-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain\ndata for training and testing.

Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on\nimportance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative\ngradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we\nintroduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO\nframeworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a\nbalanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping\nproperly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a\ngradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,\npreventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these\ndesigns act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and\nsubstantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL\nregularization.

It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

Apart from traditional approaches,\ndeep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and\nGradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in\ndistinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI\ndriven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists\nregarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works\nmostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying\ncausal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific\nfactors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a\nnovel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified\nCausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT\nimages. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal\ninference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major\nrisk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent\ncausal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through\nGCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD\ncausal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for\nvarious tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.\n","authors":["Daeyoung Kim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02781v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26052v1","updated":"2025-10-30T01:10:25Z","published":"2025-10-30T01:10:25Z","title":"Dynamic VLM-Guided Negative Prompting for Diffusion Models","summary":"  We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion\nmodels that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate\nnegative prompts during the denoising process.

To\nbridge the domain gap between open-domain priors and small-scale game datasets,\nwe propose a multi-phase training strategy with a domain adapter that decouples\ngame style learning from action control. This decoupling ensures that action\ncontrol learning is no longer bound to specific game styles, thereby achieving\nscene-generalizable action control.

Conventional\nretrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw\npassages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to\nthe LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that\nredefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that\nformalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge\nrepresentations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP\ndefines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into\ntask-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates\nraw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates\nreusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes\ndocuments into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All\nthree pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not\nraw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for\nreasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol\nthrough an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for\nglobal coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical\nexploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style\nsynthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient\ncontext.

In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world.

There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions.

Motivated by these\npotentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent\nframework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are\nlimited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a\nprincipled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into\nstructured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,\nfollowed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through\nprompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model\ninvocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design\nenables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different\nsignal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the\nversatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in\ncommunication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity\nrecognition, and text compression.

In certain situations, ensuring trust in\npredictions might require following specific partial monotonicity constraints.\nHowever, certifying if an already-trained ANN is partially monotonic is\nchallenging. Therefore, ANNs are often disregarded in some critical\napplications, such as credit scoring, where partial monotonicity is required.\nTo address this challenge, this paper presents a novel algorithm (LipVor) that\ncertifies if a black-box model, such as an ANN, is positive based on a finite\nnumber of evaluations. Consequently, since partial monotonicity can be\nexpressed as a positivity condition on partial derivatives, LipVor can certify\nwhether an ANN is partially monotonic.

Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%.

To address this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey\nof HGNN-based anomaly detection methods in cybersecurity. We introduce a\ntaxonomy that classifies approaches by anomaly type and graph dynamics, analyze\nrepresentative models, and map them to key cybersecurity applications. We also\nreview commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting\ntheir strengths and limitations. Finally, we identify key open challenges\nrelated to modeling, data, and deployment, and outline promising directions for\nfuture research. This survey aims to establish a structured foundation for\nadvancing HGNN-based anomaly detection toward scalable, interpretable, and\npractically deployable solutions.\n","authors":["Laura Jiang","Reza Ryan","Qian Li","Nasim Ferdosian"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26307v1.pdf","comment":"37 pages, 4 figures, 86 references.

Moreover,\nreal-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.\nFor example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses\ndifferently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying\nsimilarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under\nscenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling\nthe imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are\nunderrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering\nof Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets\nfrom multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize\nutility for a test user.

Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on\nimportance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative\ngradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the\nimportance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs\nsubstantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution\nprevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing\nthe mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a\nresult, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization\nstage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as\nimage quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making\nthe learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we\nintroduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO\nframeworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a\nbalanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping\nproperly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a\ngradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,\npreventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these\ndesigns act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and\nsubstantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL\nregularization.
